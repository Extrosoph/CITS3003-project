The program is built on Ubuntu 20.4.
The program is built on personal computers of both the team members. These have not been tested on CSSE lab computers.
Includes a 'clean' project (clean all using cmake).
Removed the content of the folder 'models-textures'. The folder exists but it is empty (please add the models to it, thanks).
